 <p>Learning HTML seems to be relatively, if you are not hard headed and stubborn!</p>

 <p>Following directions will make your life easier, so follow certain rules of Coding will make your projects easier</p>

 <p>so certain mistakes can mess up your entire page, such as orgetting to add a ; or a / when it is needed in either HTML or CSS</p>

 <p>Forgetting these items could  completely ruin your web page and design, See I originally wanted the  Cool beach scene, why it is cluttering this page, I like it so I kept it, that's how I roll.</P>

 <p>Since computers are stupid, and I want to make my page unigue, I need to add color codes and back ground images, using a CSS color wheel and doing research on how CSS and  HTML work together in unison to make a great web page.</P>

 <p>Now I had originally made a menu, with food Items, since you know I did not fully read the directions, like a bad lad, my work has been sent back to me. But that is OK that is how we learn to be successful in life, you fail, you get back up again and move forward. </P>

      <p><b>Some CSS elements I tried but failed, so I removed them</b></P>

     <p><li4><b> OK the last person that reviewed my work, as it was labeled a "beach Bum Menu" wanted a Strawberry Margarita from my menu, and was disappointed I did not provide such a link,  so here you go. I tried to use  some different CSS in my corrections, hopefully I did not screw it up to much. HEHE; So off the beaten path of the project, Enjoy!! </b></li4></p>
